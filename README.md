# Morse_Converter
Convertisseur de morse (pas encore op√©rationnel)

How to use it :

In terminal only.

./morse "[YOUR_PHRASE]"

It will give you the associated morse code.

./morse"[YOUR_MORSE_CODE]"

It will give you the associated sentence.

P.S. : The sentence converter only know the alphabet, the decimal numbers and spaces. The morse knows spaces as '/'. The morse code does not know anything more than '.' and '_' (underscore).

Have fun !
